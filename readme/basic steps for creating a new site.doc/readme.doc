Initial Setup
1. Create a blank working folder and run npm init to create a package.json file
2. Create and app.js file and install necessary dependencies all dependencies will be saved to the package.json file and will need to be required and saved to a variable at the top of the app.js file.
3. open a sandbox database with mongo lab and save the user credentials under the app config section on the app.js file connect to the database
4. while you are in the app config area setup the configuration for the require statements

All 3 basic routes ie mortgage-advice, mortgage-news and rates have been set up add some dummy data to each
ensure that header and footer are working on each page 
after the password authentication routes are added block the registration route and form leave detailed instructions on how to open the route.
Create a logout button that only appears in the header when a user is logged in.
We will also need to add the ability to update and change a password.
Create a form for entering a new client into the data base from within the logged in user interface 
add the ability to update and change your password 
Block all routes that users should not have access to and add this process to the routes folder.
create a user interface where you can easily edit posts on the create and edit pages add info on what css classes can be used
****install bootstrap and pick the segments that you need 
install a responsive grid 

****install sass and add a link to the style sheet to the header
Install all of the working tracking tags see notes left in the header file 
Add Google Maps to the app



Things To learn 

how to pass a variable to a route depending on what element on a page is clicked think about the dashboard sinario and how page being linked to needs to display 
models and data associations simple project would be estate agent allowing viewers to talk to sellers and bid etc. Rewatch videos on bootcamp about associating comments.



Add the delete route to all routes files.
