Models

1. Set up the models in their own seperate folder we do not need to add these to the app.js file because they will be required by the routes 
2. We will need to require mongoose at the top of each model file and then export the schema at the bottom of each file learn a bit more about data associations.

var mongoose = require("mongoose");

var mortgageAdviceSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    image: String,
    title: String,
    content: String,
    metatitle: String,
    metadescription: String,
    categorie: String,
    author: String,
    authorPic: String,
    _id: String
});

module.exports = mongoose.model("mortgageAdvice", mortgageAdviceSchema);
